# This file lists all the hosts that should be used when running
# ansible commands. To add new hosts, create a new 2-line stanza
# for them under "all" and add them to any appropriate groups
# below.
#
# NOTE: several ansible playbooks use these categories to affect
#       what hosts are acted upon (and how) by those playbooks.
#       Do not change these categories or add/remove hosts to these
#       categories without understanding the ramifications.

#
# AllHosts is meant to cover all hosts that Ansible is meant to
# do things to. Generally, individual machines should be in one
# of the children categories (maaaaaaaybe two in some odd case?).
#
# See each section for each category for a description of what
# they are supposed to cover.
